```

Visit: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) for the interactive Swagger UI.

### 6. Launch the Dashboard

```bash
streamlit run dashboard/app.py --server.port 8501
```

Visit: [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

### 7. Run Batch Predictions

```bash
python scripts/predict.py --input data/raw/telco_churn.csv --output data/processed/predictions.csv --actions
```

### 8. Run Tests

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

## 📈 What Makes This Project Stand Out

1. **Business-Value Optimization** — Doesn't just maximize accuracy; optimizes the threshold for maximum expected profit using configurable retention costs and customer lifetime value.

2. **Calibrated Probabilities** — Uses isotonic regression calibration so that a "60% churn risk" truly means 60%.

3. **Full Explainability Stack** — SHAP-based global importance, per-customer explanations, and what-if analysis for actionable insights.

4. **Next-Best-Action Engine** — Goes beyond prediction to recommend specific retention actions ranked by ROI.

5. **Drift Monitoring** — PSI-based feature and prediction drift detection to know when the model needs retraining.

6. **Production Architecture** — FastAPI backend, Streamlit dashboard, model registry with versioning, and comprehensive logging.

7. **Every Line Commented** — Every single line of code has an explanatory comment for maximum readability and learning.
